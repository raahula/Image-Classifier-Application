## Installation:
This project is based on Python 3.7.0 (default, Jun 28 2018, 08:04:48) running in an anaconda 5.3.0 distribution.

## Summary:
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. It can be used in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower that the phone's camera is looking at. I will train this classifier, then export it for use in my application. I'll be using a dataset of 102 flower categories.

## File descriptions:

The project consists of the following files.
- predict.py - predicting the species
- train.py - Training and saving the model

## Results:
The model performs reasonably well to predict the species of the flower.
